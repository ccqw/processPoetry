processPoetry
=============

These are programs to generate poetry with UNIX and Python. This group of projects was begun in [Allison Parrish's](https://github.com/aparrish) ITP class [_Reading and Writing Electronic Texts_](http://rwet.decontextualize.com/)

Output from scratcher.py, [Susan Scratched](https://www.behance.net/gallery/28957967/Susan-Scratched), has been published in German translation (translator: Hannes Bajohr) along with an essay about its conception in the anthology Code und Konzept (edited by [Hannes Bajohr](http://hannesbajohr.de/)), as well as in Issue 13 of the literary magazine, [Metamorphosen](http://www.magazin-metamorphosen.de/).
